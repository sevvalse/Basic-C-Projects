# Basic C Projects
This repo includes the C programs I wrote during my first semester at Yaşar University. These mini-projects helped me understand the fundamentals of programming. You can find simple examples covering variables, loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, and pointers.

- **Basic ATM Application**
  * This program simulates a simple ATM system. The initial balance is 1000, and users can check their balance, deposit, withdraw, or exit. The balance updates after each transaction, and the program displays the result. It runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit with a “Goodbye!” message. Invalid inputs trigger a warning, and the user is asked to try again.
  
- **Basic Calculator**
  *This is a simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users choose an option, enter two numbers, and see the result. Division checks for zero. Option 5 exits the program with a goodbye message. Invalid inputs show an error, and the program runs until exit is selected.
  
- **Divisors**
  * This program finds and prints all divisors of a user-entered number. It checks numbers from 1 up to the input and prints those that divide it without a remainder. The program ends after showing all divisors.
  
- **GPA Calculator**
  *This program calculates a student’s GPA from midterm (40%) and final (60%) scores. Users enter scores between 0 and 100, or -1 to exit. After input, the GPA is calculated and shown. The process repeats until the user quits.

- **Number Guessing Game**
  * This C program is a Number Guessing Game. It picks a random number from 1 to 100, and the player has 10 tries to guess it. After each guess, the program says “UP” if too low, “DOWN” if too high, or a success message if correct. The player can replay or exit after the game.
    
- **Theatre Seat Manager**
   * This C program manages theatre seats using a menu. Users can view, book, or cancel seats stored in a 2D array. It includes input validation and helps learn arrays, enums, and user input handling.
