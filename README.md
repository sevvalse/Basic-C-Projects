# Basic C Projects

### **1. Basic ATM Application**

This program simulates a simple ATM system, allowing users to check their balance, deposit, and withdraw funds. The program operates in a continuous loop until the user chooses to exit.

**Topics Covered:**
* Basic I/O operations
* Loops and conditional statements

---

### **2. Basic Calculator**

This command-line calculator performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes error handling to prevent division by zero and manage invalid user input. The application runs in a loop, allowing for multiple calculations.

**Topics Covered:**
* Arithmetic operations
* Loops and conditional logic

---

### **3. Divisors**

This program finds and prints all divisors of a positive integer entered by the user. It iterates from 1 up to the given number, checking for and printing any value that divides the input evenly.

**Topics Covered:**
* `for` loops
* Modulus operator

---

### **4. GPA Calculation**

This program calculates a student's GPA based on weighted midterm (40%) and final (60%) scores. The program includes input validation to ensure scores are within a valid range and allows for multiple calculations.

**Topics Covered:**
* Function usage
* Loops
* Input validation

---

### **5. Number Guessing Game**

This is a classic number guessing game where the computer selects a random number, and the user has 10 attempts to guess it. The program provides feedback after each guess, indicating if the guess was too high or too low, and allows the user to play again.

**Topics Covered:**
* Random number generation
* Loops and conditional logic

---

### **6. Theatre Seat Manager**

This program simulates a seat management system for a 5x5 seating chart. Users can view seat availability, book a seat, or cancel a booking. The program uses a 2D array to represent the seating chart and includes input validation.

**Topics Covered:**
* Arrays (2D)
* Enums
* Functions
* User interaction with a menu
