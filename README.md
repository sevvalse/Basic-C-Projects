# Basic C Projects
 A collection of simple C projects created for learning and practicing basic programming concepts. Suitable for beginners looking to enhance their coding skills.

- **Basic ATM Application**
  * This program allows users to perform basic banking transactions through an ATM system. Initially the account balance is set to 1000. The user is presented with a menu and options include checking balance, depositing, withdrawing funds or shutting down the system. The user makes a selection and the program performs the action based on the selection. It updates the balance in deposit or withdrawal transactions and writes the current status to the screen. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit, when exit is selected the program says “Goodbye!” It ends with the message. A warning is given for incorrect entries and the user is expected to enter correctly.
    
  
- **Basic Calculator**
  * This program is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users select an option from a menu (1-5), input two numbers for operations, and see the result. Division checks for zero to prevent errors. Option 5 exits the program with a farewell. Invalid inputs prompt error messages, and the program runs until the user chooses to exit.
  
- **Divisors**
  * This program determines and prints all the divisors of a given number entered by the user. When the program runs, the user is prompted to input an integer. The divisors function then iterates through all numbers from 1 to the entered number and checks if each one divides the input number without leaving a remainder. If the condition is satisfied, the current number is a divisor, and it is printed. The program continues this process until all possible divisors of the input number are found and displayed. Finally, the program terminates successfully.
  
- **GPA Calculator**
  * This program calculates a student's GPA based on their midterm (40%) and final exam (60%) scores. The user inputs scores, which are validated to be between 0 and 100. Entering -1 exits the program. After both scores are provided, the GPA is calculated and displayed. The process repeats until the user opts to quit.

- **Number Guessing Game**
  * This program is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in C. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has 10 chances to guess it correctly. After each guess, the program provides feedback—"UP" if the guess is too low, "DOWN" if it's too high, and a success message if the number is guessed correctly. At the end of the game, the player can choose to replay by entering 'Y' or exit by entering 'N'.
